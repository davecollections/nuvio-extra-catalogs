# AGENTS.md

## Purpose

This repository provides additional Stremio-compatible catalog sources for Nuvio where useful collection data is not already exposed natively or through Nuvio's official TMDB catalogue add-on.

## Current phase

V0.4 is complete. Its commit-pinned preview passed Nuvio acceptance, the deployed GitHub Pages manifest and all four catalogues byte-match the accepted merge commit, and the exact tested state is preserved on `release/v0.4.0`. V0.4 includes the complete Academy Best Actress winner history, the shared acting-output path, and canonical People artwork resolution for all 245 current award people. The previous V0.3 rollback point remains preserved on `release/v0.3.0`.

## Guardrails

- Do not duplicate the full official Nuvio TMDB catalogue add-on unless there is a demonstrated need.
- Reuse existing components, helpers, data mappings, schemas, artwork conventions, validators, and interaction patterns before creating new ones. If functionality is being recreated, prefer extending or reusing the existing implementation and document any justified exception.
- Prefer IMDb `tt` IDs for add-on catalogue items where cross-add-on metadata resolution is required.
- Keep catalog IDs stable once users may have installed the manifest or used a catalogue in a Collection.
- `manifest.json` catalogue IDs must exactly match their corresponding files under `catalog/{type}/`.
- Catalog responses must use valid Stremio Meta Preview objects.
- Keep this add-on catalog-only unless a future requirement proves that a `meta` resource or live backend is necessary.
- The add-on may rely on another compatible installed metadata provider, such as Nuvio's official TMDB add-on, for full title metadata.
- Do not add automated scraping of TMDB award web pages.
- Do not commit API keys, tokens, credentials, or secrets.
- Historical awards data must follow `docs/awards-source-strategy.md`, including a documented authority, reviewed identity enrichment, shared validation, and a maintainable generation process before expansion.
- Preserve TMDB Person IDs in awards data when a category relates to a person so the data can integrate with Nuvio native `PERSON` / `DIRECTOR` sources and existing People artwork.
- Treat GitHub Pages as static hosting unless a future requirement genuinely needs a live backend.

## Reuse-first rule

Before creating a new file format, helper, mapping, validator, artwork lookup, source type, or interaction pattern, check whether an equivalent already exists in this repository or in the established Nuvio/TMDB collection workflow. Reuse or extend first. Create a parallel implementation only when the existing one cannot meet the requirement cleanly.

## Development workflow

- Track meaningful work in GitHub Issues before implementation where practical.
- Keep each issue focused on one coherent outcome.
- Make small, understandable commits tied to the active issue.
- Run `python scripts/validate_awards_data.py` before category-specific generators and checks whenever canonical awards data changes.
- Test catalogue/manifest changes in Nuvio before considering the issue complete.
- Use semantic versions for meaningful known-good milestones rather than every commit.
- Preserve known-good release points so rollback is straightforward.
- Do not change a released catalogue ID without an explicit migration plan.

## Post-merge housekeeping

After a pull request is merged:

- Confirm the related GitHub Issue is closed or update it with any remaining work.
- Confirm `main` contains the intended merged result before starting the next issue.
- In the local clone, switch back to `main`, fetch/pull the latest changes, and make sure the working tree is clean.
- Delete the merged local feature branch once it is no longer needed and there are no uncommitted changes on it.
- Delete the merged remote feature branch unless it is intentionally retained.
- Prune stale remote-tracking branches so deleted remote branches do not remain visible locally.
- Do not delete `main`, release branches such as `release/v0.1.0`, or branches intentionally preserved as rollback points.
- If the merged work changes the live manifest/catalogue, confirm GitHub Pages has deployed successfully and perform the relevant Nuvio smoke test.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` when the merge completes a notable milestone or changes released behaviour.
- Create or preserve an appropriate version/tag/release point when the merged work represents a meaningful known-good release.

## Validated behaviour through V0.4

- Manifest version `0.4.0` installs and validates in Nuvio; the deployed GitHub Pages payload byte-matches the accepted preview.
- Best Picture catalogue loads on the Nuvio home screen.
- Best Actor Winning Films loads alongside Best Picture with 100 associated films.
- Best Actress Winning Films loads with 101 associated films in newest-ceremony-first order.
- The 41st ceremony's Best Actress tie renders both films, and the 1st ceremony's single award renders all three credited films.
- Best Director Winning Films loads with 99 associated films in newest-ceremony-first order.
- The 1st ceremony's separate Comedy and Dramatic directing winners both render, while joint-director winning films remain single catalogue entries.
- All 245 unique Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Director identities resolve the canonical People manifest by TMDB Person ID with complete required artwork.
- Refresh Add-on applies the deployed manifest update without requiring reinstallation.
- The catalogue appears in Nuvio's Add Catalog selector.
- The catalogue can be added to a Folder and that Folder can be used in a Collection.
- Collection output renders the catalogue items correctly.
- Seeded IMDb-ID movies resolve full metadata through the user's compatible installed metadata provider.
- Disabling the metadata provider prevents full metadata resolution while the add-on catalogue itself remains available.

## Next milestone

Select and open a focused GitHub Issue for the next awards-category expansion before implementation. Continue to reuse the canonical awards model, shared generators, native Nuvio person/director sources, and the existing People-artwork integration contract.
